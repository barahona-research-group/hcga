    Features based on the reciprocity in a directed graph.

    The reciprocity of a directed graph is defined as the ratio
    of the number of edges pointing in both directions to the total
    number of edges in the graph.
    Formally, $r = |{(u,v) \in G|(v,u) \in G}| / |{(u,v) \in G}|$.

    The reciprocity of a single node u is defined similarly,
    it is the ratio of the number of edges in both directions to
    the total number of edges attached to node u.
