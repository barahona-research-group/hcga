    This algorithm partitions a network into two sets by iteratively
    swapping pairs of nodes to reduce the edge cut between the two sets.  The
    pairs are chosen according to a modified form of Kernighan-Lin, which
    moves node individually, alternating between sides to keep the bisection
    balanced.
