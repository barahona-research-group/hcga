    Returns features based on the k component structure of a graph.

    A `k`-component is a maximal subgraph of a graph G that has, at least,
    node connectivity `k`: we need to remove at least `k` nodes to break it
    into more components. `k`-components have an inherent hierarchical
    structure because they are nested in terms of connectivity: a connected
    graph can contain several 2-components, each of which can contain
    one or more 3-components, and so forth.
