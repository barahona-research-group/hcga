    """Simple cycles class.

    Computes features based on simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph.

    A `simple cycle`, or `elementary circuit`, is a closed path where
    no node appears twice. Two elementary circuits are distinct if they
    are not cyclic permutations of each other.

    Cycles calculations using networkx:
        `Cycles <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/\
            cycles.html>`_
