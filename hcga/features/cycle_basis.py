    """Cycle Basis class.

    Computes features based on the cycles in the graph.

    A basis for cycles of a network is a minimal collection of cycles
    such that any cycle in the network can be written as a sum of cycles in the basis.
    Here summation of cycles is defined as “exclusive or” of the edges.
    Cycle bases are useful, e.g. when deriving equations for electric circuits
    using Kirchhoff’s Laws.
