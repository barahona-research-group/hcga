    Features based on node features.

    Here, we use the node features in various ways to compute new features.

    1. Aggregate node features (ignores graph structure).
    2. Convolute node features using message-passing, then aggregate (incorporates graph structure).

    Graph convolutions follow a similar pattern to that of graph neural networks [1]_.
