    Features based on the efficiency of a gaph.
    The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes is the multiplicative inverse of the
    shortest path distance between the nodes [1]_. Returns 0 if no path
    between nodes.

    Uses networkx: `Efficiency Measures <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/\
        algorithms/efficiency_measures.html>`_
