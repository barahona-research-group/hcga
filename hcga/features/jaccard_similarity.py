    Create the Jaccard similarity matrix for nodes in the network,
    then convert this to a graph and extract some features
    This is defined as a/(a+b+c), where
    a = number of common neighbours
    b = number of neighbours of node 1 that are not neighbours of node 2
    c = number of neighbours of node 2 that are not neighbours of node 1
    Treating this matrix as an adjacency matrix, we can compute network some features
    ref: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/112540v4.full

    For some features we remove selfloops, since the diagonal of the Jaccard
    similarity consists of ones, and therefore all nodes will have a selfloop with weight one
